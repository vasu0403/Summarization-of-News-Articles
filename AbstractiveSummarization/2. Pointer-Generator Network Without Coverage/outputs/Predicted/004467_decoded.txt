eleven football fans have had their death sentences upheld after a retrial over a stadium riot in egypt which left 74 people dead .
an appeals court ordered the retrial of 73 defendants last year after rejecting a lower court 's verdict .
the riot erupted in february 2012 when supporters of home team al-masry - from the canal city of port said - and cairo 's al-ahly clashed after an egyptian league match .
