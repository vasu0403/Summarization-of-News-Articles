england test captain alastair cook feared jonathan trott 's international career was over 18 months ago , but feels he is now ready to face the ` pressure cooker ' once again .
cook was concerned that would be the end of his three lions days but has watched the 33-year-old rebuild his career with typical focus and determination , first with warwickshire then during a productive winter tour with england lions .
