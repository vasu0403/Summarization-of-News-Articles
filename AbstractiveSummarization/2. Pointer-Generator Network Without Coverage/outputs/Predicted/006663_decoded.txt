ethan czahor has launched ` clear ' which removes any posts that might cause you problems with your current or future employer .
users can search for keywords such as ` gay ' , ` black ' or swear words and the program deletes any tweet that mentions them .
mr czahor said hoped the app would ensure others do not suffer the same fate as he did .
