chelsea manager jose mourinho said he was unfazed by his side 's staggeringly low possession stat during the 1-0 win over manchester united and all that mattered to him was achieving a positive result .
the blues , who secured victory through forward eden hazard 's first-half strike , held the ball for just 29 per cent of the match at stamford bridge - their lowest total over 90 minutes since opta started recording this sort of data in 2006 .
