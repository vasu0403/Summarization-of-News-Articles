manchester united manager louis van gaal has praised the resurrection of marouane fellaini as the big belgian prepares to play in the fixture that marked the low point of his old trafford career 12 months ago .
on march 25 last year , fellaini was jeered by both city and united fans as he was substituted in a 3-0 united defeat that proved the deathknell to the manager who signed him , david moyes .
even more hurtfully , reds legend paul scholes was scathing about fellaini 's united career up that point .
