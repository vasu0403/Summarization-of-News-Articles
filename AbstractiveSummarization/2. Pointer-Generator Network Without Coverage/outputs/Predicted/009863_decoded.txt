former soldier john young , 66 , and his new wife elaine , 54 , were sat in the front room of their home in oldham , greater manchester , when thugs began pelting his front window with stones .
when one brick smashed the glass , mr young went and opened his front door to remonstrate with the attackers only to be struck in his left eye by another brick .
doctors were unable to save his eyesight meaning he is now blind in one eye .
