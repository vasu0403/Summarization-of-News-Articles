alastair cook may have had a long break working on his batting with his old mentor graham gooch but his technical problems very much remain .
the england captain , without an international century for almost two years , failed for the second time in the first test as his old failing against the full ball just outside off-stump was again exploited by west indies .
cook returned to something like his best last year with three half-centuries in his last four test innings .
