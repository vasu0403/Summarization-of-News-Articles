fast bowler jimmy anderson made cricket history in the caribbean on friday by beating the great sir ian botham 's all-time england wicket-taking record with his 384th victim in his hundredth test .
botham 's record had been a long wait until the final day of the first test against the west indies for anderson 's large group of family and friends watching from a box high in the stands of the sir vivian richards stadium .
