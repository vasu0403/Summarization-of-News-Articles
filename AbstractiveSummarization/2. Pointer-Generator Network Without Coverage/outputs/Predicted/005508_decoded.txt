the southern poverty law center in february filed a lawsuit against georgia department of corrections officials on behalf of ashley diamond , a transgender woman .
the lawsuit says prison officials have failed to provide adequate treatment for diamond 's gender dysphoria , a condition that causes a person to experience extreme distress because of a disconnect between the birth sex and gender identity .
prison officials must treat an inmate 's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition .
