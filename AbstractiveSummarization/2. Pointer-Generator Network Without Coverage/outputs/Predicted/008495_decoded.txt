nina anderson searched pawn shops near her house in portsmouth , hampshire , after gold and silver necklaces worth nearly # 400 .
the great-grandmother , who lives with husband maurice , 75 , eventually spotted two of the stolen items in the window of a cash and cheque express in the city centre two months after the raid .
her actions , which echo those of agatha christie character miss marple , led to the arrest of burglar martin campbell , who has now been jailed for three years .
