ukip has failed to outpoll the liberal democrats for the first time since 2013 in a fresh blow to nigel farage 's faltering election campaign .
the poll is the latest bad news for mr farage , and undermines his claim yesterday that support for ukip has ` rallied ' after a lacklustre few weeks .
labour has yet to be out in front in any comres telephone poll this year .
