four-year-old hudea was pictured late last year by photographer osman sagirli in atmeh refugee camp , just 10km from the border with turkey .
she , her mother and three siblings are understood to have been living in the syrian camp since hudea 's father was killed in the 2012 hama massacre .
but two weeks ago , the family took a fateful decision to move south , towards the city of idlib - only for it to fall into the hands of al qaeda .
