vietnamese labourer pham quang lanh , 28 , had a metal plate inserted over his skull after being struck by an iron bar on a building site .
but the botched operation caused his head to become swollen with a potentially deadly infection .
it was only when he asked family to look at the wound that they noticed a dozen maggots crawling under the skin .
