the tiny montana outpost was established in the 1860s by miners looking for gold and silver , but it was devastated by fire around 1912 and deserted a few years later .
while the town has since been restored , it remains empty , and local folklore says the area is haunted by some of its former residents , but is now set to boom once again and become a new tourist stop .
