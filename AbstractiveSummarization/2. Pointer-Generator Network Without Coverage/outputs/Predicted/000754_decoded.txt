iran will sign a final nuclear agreement only if economic sanctions against the nation are removed on the first day of the deal 's implementation , president hassan rouhani said thursday .
ayatollah ali khamenei , the islamic republic 's supreme leader , told state-run media outlets he is neither in favor nor against the proposed deal because it is n't final , and he 's not certain it will become binding because he has `` never been optimistic about negotiations with the u.s. ''
