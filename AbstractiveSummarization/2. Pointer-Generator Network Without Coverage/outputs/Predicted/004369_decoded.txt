arsenal duo alex oxlade-chamberlain and kieran gibbs appear to have convinced american rapper tyga to nail his colours to the red half of north london .
tyga , who has been making headlines during the last few months for dating the youngest kardashian sister - 17-year-old kylie jenner , appeared to dye his hair red to show his support to arsenal .
the injured oxlade-chamberlain could return to action in time to face hull on monday .
