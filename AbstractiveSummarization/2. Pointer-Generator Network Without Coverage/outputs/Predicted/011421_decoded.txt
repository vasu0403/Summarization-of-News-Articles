greystone park psychiatric center , in new jersey , was built to house hundreds of mentally ill patients , but it eventually was home to fall into disarray .
it has long been abandoned and has been left to fall into disarray , now known for its crumbling walls , flaking plaster and gaping holes in ceilings and staircases which has allowed some of the rooms to be filled with leaves and snow .
