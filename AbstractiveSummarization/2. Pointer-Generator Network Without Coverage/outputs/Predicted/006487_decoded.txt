detectives investigating the hatton garden gem heist missed the most crucial cctv footage so far until it was flagged up by a worker based 50ft from the crime scene .
the worker had reportedly contacted 101 - the police non-emergency number - on monday last week , believing detectives would already have similar images of the # 60m raid .
