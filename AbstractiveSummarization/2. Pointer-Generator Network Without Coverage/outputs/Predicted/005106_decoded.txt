staff at scooter 's coffee , in omaha , were locked out of the page for almost 24 hours , starting at 5pm on sunday , by an ` unknown third party ' who then took control of the picture feed .
instead of the usual images of smoothies , coffees and cookies , the page was plastered with adult cartoons - similar to those posted on delta air lines and crayola 's pages after they were hacked .
