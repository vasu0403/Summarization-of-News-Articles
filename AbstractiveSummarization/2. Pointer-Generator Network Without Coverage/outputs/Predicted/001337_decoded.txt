warrington crashed to a third straight super league defeat in the cheshire derby .
the game was stopped for eight minutes after a flare was thrown from the stand housing visiting fans but widnes maintained their focus to run out 30-10 winners and maintain their impressive form at the select security stadium , where they have taken seven points out of a possible 10 this year .
warrington 's losing run is their worst since 2009 and their misery was compounded by the loss of winger matty russell with a leg injury .
