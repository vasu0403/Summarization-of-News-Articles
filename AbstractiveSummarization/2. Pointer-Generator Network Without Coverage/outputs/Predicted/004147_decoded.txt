a lion had an unfortunate accident when it got its head stuck in a feeding barrel at a zoo in the netherlands .
zoo keepers place food in barrels to stimulate the lions , as it replicates the challenges faced when the animals feed in the wild .
the animal , hoping to beat two other lions to the food , reaches in too far and gets its head stuck .
