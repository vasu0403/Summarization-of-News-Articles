the boy picked up the unwrapped condom in his school playground at bennett elementary in bennett , colorado last week .
his mother , who was only identified as alicia to protect her son , said it would be a year before her son had the all-clear from his std testing .
the condom was thrown in the thrash by a member of the teaching staff so could not be tested for potential diseases .
