ian merrett , 28 , is astonished that poppy smart , 23 , did not take it as a compliment , which he says has helped him ` snog loads of girls ' in the past .
the builder and his colleagues whistled at her every day for a month as she passed their worcester construction site .
mr merrett admits it was probably him whistling but called miss smart a ` silly little girl '
