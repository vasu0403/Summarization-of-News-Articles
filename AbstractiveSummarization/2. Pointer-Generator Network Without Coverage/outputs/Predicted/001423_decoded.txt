kolo toure has warned raheem sterling that leaving liverpool could see him end up on the scrapheap at a big club , similar to the way that jack rodwell and scott sinclair did at manchester city .
but toure , who used to play for city with rodwell and sinclair , has warned his anfield team-mate a move to one of european football 's heavyweights may not be everything he has dreamed of .
toure joined city in a # 12million deal in 2012 .
