turkey has lifted a block on social media sites in the country after twitter , facebook and youtube agreed to remove chilling images of a prosecutor being held at gunpoint by left wing extremists .
turkey initially demanded domestic newspapers stop running the ` terrorist propaganda ' images , before going on to block access to twitter , facebook and youtube .
turkey has since threatened to block access to google unless images of the siege are removed from its search function .
