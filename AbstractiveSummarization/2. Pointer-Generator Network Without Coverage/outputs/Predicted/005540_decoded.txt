he said he survived for more than two months on his stricken boat by eating fish he caught by trailing dirty clothes in the ocean , and by catching rainwater in a bucket .
but doubters have questioned how jordan -- who declined medical help despite claiming to have broken a shoulder , he appeared to be well-fed .
