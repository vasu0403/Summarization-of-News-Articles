amir khan believes kell brook has called him out so that he can have the ` one big payday ' which has so far eluded him during his 10-and-a-half year career .
brook , who defeated jo jo dan to retain his ibf welterweight title last month , immediately challenged khan in a post-fight interview but the bolton-born boxer has instead agreed a bout on may 30 .
khan has reiterated his intention to take on brook within the next 12 months .
