benik afobe kept their fading promotion hopes alive as his 31st goal of the season salvaged a 1-1 sky bet championship draw against play-off rivals ipswich at molineux .
afobe , who scored 19 goals on loan at mk dons before joining wolves from arsenal in january for # 2million , pounced after 50 minutes to cancel out a 21st-minute own goal from richard stearman .
it was a vital strike from afobe as the black country side were heading for a third successive defeat which would have all but ended their play-off hopes .
