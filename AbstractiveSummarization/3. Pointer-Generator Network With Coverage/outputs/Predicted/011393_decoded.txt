kevin love , who dislocated his left shoulder on sunday , has criticized his opponent for what he called a ` bush-league ' play .
cleveland 's power forward was injured in the first quarter of the cavaliers ' 101-93 victory that completed a four-game sweep when he and boston 's kelly olynyk chased a loose ball into the left corner after jae crowder of the celtics missed a 3-pointer .
olynyk was charged with a non-shooting foul .
