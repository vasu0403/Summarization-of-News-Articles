spacex has released dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the atlantic .
the video , taken from a plane yesterday , shows the falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform , before a gust of wind sways it to one side .
the 14-storey booster manages to hit the barge , but its high speed and tilt causes it to explode on impact .
