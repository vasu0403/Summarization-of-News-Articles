five staff members sustained serious injuries after taking a joy ride down ` the super slide ' at the sydney royal easter show on saturday night , despite the slide being closed after heavy rain made it too dangerous .
it is understood a group of eight contracted workers broke into the 52-metre slide after it was closed earlier in the night due to fears the heavy rain would make the slide particularly slippery .
