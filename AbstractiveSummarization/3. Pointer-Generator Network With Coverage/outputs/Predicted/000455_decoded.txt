gov. mike pence issued an executive order monday to extend a public health emergency in his state in response to a rampant hiv outbreak that first began in mid-december .
as of tuesday , there were 135 cases -- 129 confirmed , and six preliminary -- of hiv .
the increase has been linked to injection drug use , primarily of the prescription opioid opana .
pence issued an order in march for scott county , which then had 79 confirmed cases of hiv since mid-december .
