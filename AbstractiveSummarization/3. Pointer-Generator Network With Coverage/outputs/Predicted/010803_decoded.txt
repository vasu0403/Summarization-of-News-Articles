remmie was left with a hazelnut sized scar on the top of her ear following a piercing .
remmie , 18 , had a thick bar put through her ear as an act of teenage rebellion , and initially hoped it would make her stand out from the crowd .
but when the piercing became inflamed , remmie was forced to remove the bar - and the resulting wound healed into a hazelnut-sized lump known as a keloid scar .
