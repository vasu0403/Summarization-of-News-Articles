jonathan trott 's first innings on his return to test cricket for the first time in 17 months was brief and unsuccessful , as he was caught at first slip just three balls in .
trott last played a test for his country in november 2013 .
but his much-anticipated return , this time as captain alastair cook 's opening partner , was over almost before it had begun when he nicked jerome taylor to darren bravo .
