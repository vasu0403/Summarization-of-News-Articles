rory mcilroy was joined by niall horan at the masters on wednesday and the world 's best golfer is set to return the favour by singing on stage with the one direction star at the end of the summer .
horan fell while caddying for the northern irish golfer in the traditional par-3 contest at augusta while he also hit a ball into the water on the ninth tee , but the irish singer will get some payback in september .
