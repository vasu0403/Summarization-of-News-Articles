andy king thinks his 50th goal for leicester city could prove to be his most important yet .
coming in the 86th minute of saturday 's match it was by no means his most spectacular , a mere flick from six yards out enough to take the ball past adrian after a scuffed jamie vardy shot .
king is joined by david nugent to celebrate his goal , the 50th he has scored for his club .
