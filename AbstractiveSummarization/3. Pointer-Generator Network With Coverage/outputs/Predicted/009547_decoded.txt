researchers at stanford university examined the reaction of secondary and primary school teachers in the united states to student race .
they found that the teachers were more likely to view youngsters who they thought were black as troublemakers than those they thought were white .
teachers tend to see black pupils as more likely to cause trouble in the future if they have misbehaved in the past .
