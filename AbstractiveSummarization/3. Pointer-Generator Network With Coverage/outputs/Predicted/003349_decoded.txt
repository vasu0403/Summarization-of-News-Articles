sixth-seeded tomas berdych overwhelmed gael monfis 6-1 , 6-4 on saturday to reach the final of the monte carlo masters for the first time .
berdych immediately took control from the baseline and monfils struggled to cope with the fast pace imposed by the big-hitting czech .
monfils won just 11 points in a lopsided first set before the frenchman changed his strategy , using more sliced shots to break up his opponent 's rhythm .
