rotherham boss steve evans was left fuming on the sidelines after his relegation-threatened side were denied a penalty in their narrow sky bet championship defeat at birmingham .
the hosts had led through first-half goals by robert tesche and clayton donaldson , before matt derbyshire pulled one back for fourth-bottom rotherham .
