jonathan trott prepared for his first test appearance since leaving the ashes tour in turmoil 18 months ago with back-to-back failures in st kitts .
trott , who looks sure to open with alastair cook in the first test against west indies in antigua on monday , fell for just two , top-edging an attempted pull against a st kitts side bolstered by england bowlers liam plunkett and mark wood .
