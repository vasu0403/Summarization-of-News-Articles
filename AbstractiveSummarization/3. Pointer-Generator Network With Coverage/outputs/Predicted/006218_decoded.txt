damon muller has almost doubled in size due to swelling and bloating since he was diagnosed with juvenile dermatomyositis -lrb- jdm -rrb- in november - a rare autoimmune disease that can only be treated with high doses of steroids and a chemotherapy-type drug .
the disease has robbed damon , from gladstone in central queensland , of the ability to run , ride his bike and play outside freely in the sun .
