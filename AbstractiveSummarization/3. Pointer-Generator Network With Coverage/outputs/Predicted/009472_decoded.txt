authorities say a second boy has died after his family 's car plunged into los angeles harbor , killing his 13-year-old brother .
the family had left a waterfront restaurant thursday night when their sedan ran off the road alongside a working dock at the port of los angeles , landing upside down in about 30 feet of water .
